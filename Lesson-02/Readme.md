## How to install Docker on Windows?

### On Windows, the procedure is almost the same, except there are a few extra steps that youâ€™ll need to go through. The installation steps are as follows:

1. Navigate to this link and install your sstem compatible version and then just click next next to install without worrying.

2. https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

3. Once the installation is done, start Docker Desktop either from the start menu or your desktop. The docker icon should show up on your taskbar.

4. Execute the docker --version and docker-compose --version commands to make sure that the installation was successful.

5. You can access Docker from your regular Command Prompt or PowerShell as well. It's just that I prefer using WSL2 over any other command line on Windows.

#### Note:- If docker is not properly installed on your machine then uninstall it and again install it. Make sure to read recommended system requirements from docker official site. Navigate to this link if you want to see discussion about hardware requirements from docker official platforms
